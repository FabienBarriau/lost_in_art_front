      Prepare for a travel inside art ! You will be sent in a virtual gallery compose
      of 13, 000 piece of art from the WikiArt website. In this adventure you will not
      meet tasteless infinite scrolling, boring pagination, not even weird popping recommendation.
      Here you can explore a reasonable amount of image at a time and highly customize you travel along the way.
      You will be lost in the good place !

<h2>About the project</h2>

<div class="p-sm-12 p-md-12 p-lg-8 p-xl-8 align">
  I love to go on DeviantArt or Instagram to see what talented artists are capable of.
  Often I don't seek for anything in particular,  I'm like an explorer except, that
  instead of looking for treasure and gold, I just want to find a great artwork.
  DeviantArt and Instagram are very good to do this, but I have some problem with
  their way of doing this.
</div>

<h3>What I don't like:</h3>
<div class="p-grid p-nogutter test">
  <div class="p-sm-12 p-md-12 p-lg-4 p-xl-4 align">
    <p-card  styleClass="ui-card-shadow" header="Infinite scrolling">
      <p>
        It's used to its capacity to retain attention,
        but as a user I don't find this really comfortable, I have the impression to be trapped.
      </p>
    </p-card>
  </div>
  <div class="p-sm-12 p-md-12 p-lg-4 p-xl-4 align">
    <p-card  styleClass="ui-card-shadow" header="Classical pagination">
    <p>
      It's an effective and well proven method, but it's also so much used, that it's a little boring now.
    </p>
    </p-card>
  </div>
  <div class="p-sm-12 p-md-12 p-lg-4 p-xl-4 align">
    <p-card  styleClass="ui-card-shadow" header="Recommended content">
    <p>
      Of course I'm not against recommendation, but I want to control when I see it and how the content is proposed.
    </p>
    </p-card>
  </div>
</div>


<p>
  This project is an experiment that aims to propose some alternative to all these problems.
</p>


<h3>Proposed alternatives:</h3>
<div class="p-grid p-nogutter test">
  <div class="p-sm-12 p-md-12 p-lg-6 p-xl-6 align">
    <p-card  styleClass="ui-card-shadow" header="Big wall">
    <p>
      What i called a big wall is an area where all images are in the same area,
      placed according to their similarities. For this visualization
      I was highly inspired by the work of Douglas Duhaime on PixPlot,
      that provide an astonishing number of images in the same big wall.
    </p>
    </p-card>
  </div>
  <div class="p-sm-12 p-md-12 p-lg-6 p-xl-6 align">
    <p-card  styleClass="ui-card-shadow" header="Customizable recommendation">
    <p>
      I integrate a recommendation system that works only when the user explicitly ask for it.
      I also try to give some control on this system with the customization of the metric and the number of recommendations that return the system.
